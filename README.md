# 📊 Mobile Sales Dashboard – Power BI Project

Hi! 👋 I'm Shreya Suryavanshi, and this is a Power BI project I worked on as part of my learning journey in data analytics and business intelligence.

I created a **Mobile Sales Dashboard** using randomly generated Excel data to simulate real-world sales insights. The goal was to take raw data and turn it into something meaningful — something that helps visualize performance, trends, and customer behavior at a glance.

## 🎯 Objective

To design an interactive and insightful sales dashboard using Power BI, showcasing how data can tell a story — from city-level sales to brand preferences and customer ratings. This project helped me understand how businesses use dashboards to make quick, informed decisions.

## 🧰 Tools & Skills Used

- **Microsoft Power BI** for dashboard creation  
- **Power Query** for data cleaning and transformation  
- **DAX** for calculated columns and measures  
- **Excel** as a mock data source
